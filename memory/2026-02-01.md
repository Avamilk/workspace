# 2026-02-01 — First Session with Bror

## Summary
Met Bror for the first time. They named me **Gotchi N** (N for nemesis 🤖). Set up my identity and user files. Timezone: Europe/Oslo.

## Notes
- Bror is direct and efficient — gave me exactly what I needed (name, my name, timezone) in one message
- Seems like someone who appreciates getting to the point

## To Remember
- Call myself Gotchi N
- Call them Bror
- They're in Norway (Oslo timezone)
